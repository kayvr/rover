# Rover

Rover operates on local filesystems by allowing you to 'subscribe' to directory updates. So you'll know if anyone, yourself included, modifies the contents of a directory. Want to subscribe to updates from another user on a pubnix? Or simply keep track of changes you're making to a git repos and directories? Rover'll do that.

This project is in active development and you will find a small overview on gemini: gemini://kayvr.com/gemlog/2022-03-17-Rover-Experiment.gmi.
